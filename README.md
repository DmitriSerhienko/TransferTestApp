Hello! I`m Dmitrii Serhienko, Android developer.

This is my test task for Wittix company. 

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.
I decided to go with basic Clean Architecture + MVVM + Compose Multiplatform + Flow

Right now, I don't have a MacBook or any other Apple device, so I can't build and test the project on iOS.
But I'm sure after a few minor adjustments, it will be easy to do.

I have practical experience with Kotlin Multiplatform. 
In the last few months, we have been migrating a project from Android to KMP.
You can check the result yourself by downloading it from the Apple Store using the [link](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6723897546).
